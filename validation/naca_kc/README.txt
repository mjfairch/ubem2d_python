This example validates the pressure distribution for steady flow past a NACA 2412 airfoil (at angle of attack of 8 degrees) vs. the linear-strength vortex-panel method presented in Figure 5.25 of Kuethe and Chow's book, "Foundations of Aerodynamics", 5th ed., page 164.

The data file was constructed by digitizing (screenshot + mouse clicks) the aforementioned figure, and therefore has a little noise in it.
