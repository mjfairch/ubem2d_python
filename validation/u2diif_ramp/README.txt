This example validates against the Naval Postgraduate School U2DIIF code in Ngai-Huat Teng's June 1987 thesis, written under the supervision of M. F. Platzer, titled:

"The development of a computer code (U2DIIF) for the numerical solution of unsteady, inviscid and incompressible flow over an airfoil".

This validation case is for an 8.4%-thick von Mises airfoil undergoing a ramp in pitch angle about its midchord from 0 radians to 0.1 radians over a duration of 1.5*tau, where tau is the convective time, studied in pages 70-82 of the thesis.  See, in particular, Figure 5.8 on page 76.

Note that the associated data file is noisy, since the data was digitized by taking a screenshot and clicking points with a mouse.
