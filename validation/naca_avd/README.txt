Here we validate the steady flow past symmetric and cambered NACA 4-digit series airfoils, specifically:

1. Lift curve (i.e. lift coefficient vs. angle of attack) for symmetric and cambered airfoils, validated against experimental data (Reynolds number ~ 10^6) collected at the massive wind tunnel at the NACA (NASA's predecessor) Langley Research Laboratory.

2. Lift curve vs. the theoretical prediction from thin-airfoil theory, namely that the slope of lift vs. angle of attack is pi^2/90 (when angles are measured in degrees; in radians the slope is 2*pi).

The aforementioned experimental data against which we validate is published in the book "Theory of Wing Sections", by Ira H. Abbott and Albert E. Von Doenhoff, Dover Publications, 1959, ISBN-10: 0486605868.  To get that data in machine readable form, we digitized it with screenshots and mouse clicks, and it therefore has some noise.
