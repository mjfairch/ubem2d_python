This example validates against the Naval Postgraduate School U2DIIF code in Ngai-Huat Teng's June 1987 thesis, written under the supervision of M. F. Platzer, titled:

"The development of a computer code (U2DIIF) for the numerical solution of unsteady, inviscid and incompressible flow over an airfoil".

This validation case is for an 8.4%-thick von Mises airfoil undergoing rapid pitch oscillations of 0.01 radians anbout the leading edge at a reduced frequency of (omega*c)/(2U) = 10, which was studied in pages 88-93 of Teng's thesis.

Note that the associated data files are noisy, since the data was digitized by taking screenshots and clicking points with a mouse.
