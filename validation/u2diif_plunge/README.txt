This example validates against the Naval Postgraduate School U2DIIF code in Ngai-Huat Teng's June 1987 thesis, written under the supervision of M. F. Platzer, titled:

"The development of a computer code (U2DIIF) for the numerical solution of unsteady, inviscid and incompressible flow over an airfoil".

This validation case is for an NACA 0015 airfoil undergoing plunge oscillations of 0.018 chords at a reduced frequency of (omega*c)/(2U) = 2.15, which was studied in pages 83-87 of Teng's thesis.  See, in particular, Figure 5.11 on page 84.

Note that the associated data files are noisy, since the data was digitized by taking screenshots and clicking points with a mouse.
